{{aside (page="wiki/syntax index")}}

Create a block of text by placing it with <nowiki>"((" and "))"</nowiki>.

This is often used in conjuntion with a css class, to format the text in a particual way.

For example, if you had a css class within your template called "blueBox", then the following would make the text appear in the blueBox style :

{{{
(((class="blueBox")
Hello World
))
}}}

This can be used with the css classes "wiki_left", "wiki_right" and "wiki_center". For example
{{{
(((class="wiki_right")
Hello World
))
}}}

(((class="wiki_right")
Hello World
))
