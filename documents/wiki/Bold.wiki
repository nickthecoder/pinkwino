Create bold text ( html <b> tag ).

Enclose the text within two sets of '''<nowiki>++</nowiki>'''. 

=== Example ===

==== Simple ====

{{{
This is the ++best++ bold text ever.
}}}

This is the ++best++ bold text ever.

==== Nested ====

You can nest other wiki markup within the bold section, here we have some italics inside the bold :

{{{
Please, ++do ''not'' do that again++, thank you.
}}}

Please, ++do ''not'' do that again++, thank you.

!! Illegal Nesting (blocks)

You cannot insert any [Blocks|Block] within a bold section. For example, the following is illegal, because the table is a block, and cannot be within a bold section.

{{{
This is ++illegal
{|
| this is a table
|}
ending bold++ now.
}}}

This is what you would see if you tried it (note that the table markup is ignored :

This is ++illegal
{|
| this is a table
|}
ending bold++ now.
