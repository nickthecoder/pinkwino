Line breaks should be used sparingly. Instead of line break, [wiki/paragraph]s are almost always preferable.

To add a line break, add "\\" at the end of the line.

! Example

{{{
This piece of text
and this one, are on the same line.\\
This is on a new line.
}}}

This piece of text
and this one, are on the same line.\\
This is on a new line.
