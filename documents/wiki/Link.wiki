{{aside (page="wiki/syntax index")}}

Links are the most important part of wiki syntax, as they people to get from one web page to another.

To link to another wiki page, simply place the name of the wiki page in square brackets :

{{{
[Table]
}}}

The above links to the [Table] page.

You can change the label that appears on the page like so :

{{{
Learn how to [create tables in this wiki|Table]
}}}

In the example above the link text is now ''"create tables in this wiki"'',
but it still links to the same wiki page ([Table]).

The character that seperates the lable from the page name is called a ''"pipe symbol"'', 
and is located to the left of the letter Z on many keyboards. (you need to use the shift key).

You can also link to external web site (i.e. pages outside of this wiki).
The syntax is the same, but you have to give the full address (url). Note, you must incude the "http://" at the front.
Copy and pasting the address from your web browsers address toolbar will prevent typos.

Here's an example linking to http://google.com :
{{{
[http://google.com]
}}}

and here it is again, but this time the label is changed to [google:http://google.com]
{{{
[google:http://google.com]
}}}

Some plugins can also create links, such as the [image|image (plugin)].
