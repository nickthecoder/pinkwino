{{aside (page="wiki/syntax index")}}

Use "<nowiki><nowiki></nowiki>blah blah</nowiki>" to turn off wiki syntax.

This is useful when you want add text that would otherwise clash with the normal wiki syntax.

For example, if I wanted to write :

{{{
My English grade was A++, which is the best
you can get!
}}}

Then, the <nowiki>++</nowiki> would clash with the wiki's [bold] syntax. To fix this, use the following :

{{{
My English grade was <nowiki>A++</nowiki>, which is the best
you can get!
}}}

And you get the following :

My English grade was <nowiki>A++</nowiki>, which is the best
you can get!
