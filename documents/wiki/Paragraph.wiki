{{aside (page="wiki/syntax index")}}

You can start a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between one block of text and another.

! Example

{{{
Hello

World
}}}

Hello

World

! Notes

Adding additional blank lines will ++not++ create a larger gap between the two paragraphs.
Paragraphs are the preferred method of splitting up blocks of text, but you can also use [wiki/line break]s

Within tables, paragraphs are disabled by default. This is because paragraphs often have padding around them, and often this padding is unwanted with a table. If you ''do'' want to have paragraphs within a table cell, nest a block with in the cell, for exameple :

{{{
{|
|
No paragraphs

in this cell
|
{{[
But look

there are paragraphs here.
]}}
|}
}}}

{|
|
No paragraphs

in this cell
|
{{[
But look

there are paragraphs here.
]}}
|}
