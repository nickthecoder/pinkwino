==In-line Quotes==

To quote a word (or words) within a paragraph, use two pairs of double quotes.

This uses the HTML ''q'' tag.

===Example===

Just one word is ""quoted"", I hope.

{{{
Just one word is ""quoted"", I hope.
}}}

==Block Quotes==

To quote a ''block of text'', use three double quotes before and after the block of text.

This uses the HTML ''blockquote'' tag with a css class ''wiki_quote''.

Note that the text is automatically split into html <p> (paragraphs) and the quotes are at the beginning and end of the paragraphs.

===Example===

A wise man once said :
"""
Too many cooks make spoil the broth.

Many hands make light work.
"""

{{{

"""
Too many cooks make spoil the broth.

Many hands make light work.
"""
}}}

==Implementation Notes==

If your style sheet does not define the ''wiki_quote'' style, then the ''block quote'' will be indented without any quote marks around it.

A simple style sheet should contain :
{{{
blockquote.wiki_quote p:before { content: "“"; }
blockquote.wiki_quote p:after { content: "”"; }
}}}

but for a flashier effect, use images for the quote marks :

{{{
blockquote.wiki_quote p:before { content: url('beginQuote.png'); white-space: nowrap; }
blockquote.wiki_quote p:after { content: url('endQuote.png'); white-space: nowrap; }
}}}
