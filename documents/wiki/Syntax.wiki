== Headings ==

To create a heading place two or more equal symbols (=) before and after the heading. The more equal signs you use the smaller the heading will be.

For example :
{{{
== Large Heading ==
=== Medium Heading ===
==== Small Heading ====
}}}

== Links ==

The examples below link to a page called ''"nowhere"'', which doesn't exist,
and to a page called ''"sandbox"'', which does exist.
{|
|(width="50%") A link to [nowhere], and a link to the [Sandbox]
|(width="50%")
{{{
 A link to [nowhere],
 and a link to the [Sandbox]
}}}
|-
| Change the name, but still link [there|nowhere].
Go [play|Sandbox].
|
{{{
Change the name,
but still link [there|nowhere].
Go [play|Sandbox].
}}}
|}

== Lists ==

{|(width="100%")
|(width="50%")
# Ordered
# lists
# are easy

|(width="50%")
{{{
# Ordered
# lists
# are easy

}}}
|-
|
* And so are
* unordered
* lists

|
{{{
* And so are
* unordered
* lists

}}}
|-
|
* Indentation
** Is trickier
** The more stars
*** The more indented
** Simple as that

|
{{{

== Tables ==

{|
|| Code
|| Meaning
|-
|
 <nowiki>{|</nowiki>
| start of a table
|-
|
 <nowiki>||</nowiki>
| begin a new header cell
|-
|
 <nowiki>|</nowiki>
| begin a new cell<br/>
|-
|
 <nowiki>|-</nowiki>
| end one row, and begin a new one
|-
|
 <nowiki>|}</nowiki>
| table end<br/>
|}

All of these have to be at the beginning of a line, but you can squash serval
table cells together on one line.

A cell can span multiple lines, however, paragraphs are not created within
table cells, so leaving a blank line does ''not'' cause a gap. If you do want
paragraphs within a table cell, place a block within the cell using 
<nowiki>{{[ your-text-here ]}}</nowiki>

{|(width="100%")
|(width="50%")
{|
|| Hello
|| World
|-
| abc
| 123
|}
|(width="50%")
{{{
{|
|| Hello
|| World
|-
| abc
| 123
|}
}}}
|}

Tables, table rows and table cells can have attributes.

== Blocks ==

without __wiki__ syntax.
}}}
Notice how the underscores are ''not'' treated as wiki syntax.
|(width="50%")

{{{

without __wiki__ syntax.

==Comments==

Sometimes you may want to add comments into your wiki markup, which are not displayed on the final page.
You can use the same syntax as HTML comments.

<!-- this isn't displayed -->
{{{
Comments
<!-- this isn't displayed -->
}}}
