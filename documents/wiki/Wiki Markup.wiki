Wiki Markup is the set of special rules which turns plain text into a formatted document.
Each wiki may have slightly different rules.
For example, this wiki uses the following markup to create a heqading :
{{{
=== My Heading ===
}}}

But other wiki's use this instead :
{{{
!! My Heading
}}}

For help on this wiki's markup rules, see [Syntax].
