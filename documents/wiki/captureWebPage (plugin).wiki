{{aside(page="plugins index")}}

Creates a buttons, which when clicked, captures a picture of a given web page, and saves it within a wiki page.

Typically, you will use this plugin on the wiki page used to store the image. See [captureWebPage example.png].

It is useful in conjuntion with the [thumbnail (plugin)], and also the [teaser (plugin)].

==Example==

{{{
{{captureWebPage url="http://google.com" page="google.com.png"}}
}}}

And you can see the results here : [google.com.png].

{{captureWebPage url="http://google.com" page="google.com.png"}}

++Note.++ Ensure that the page name ends with ``".png"``, otherwise you won't be able to use the image as intended.

== Details ==

{{plugin plugin="captureWebPage"}}

===page===
The name of the wiki page where the image is saved. This should end in ".png".

===url===
The address of the web page you wish to copy. It must be a full url, such as :
http://google.co.uk/

==Implementation Notes==

The current implementation uses [wkhtmltoimage|http://wkhtmltopdf.org/], and this requires that the servlet engine has a X11 display device.

You will probably want to use [Xvfb|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb] because web servers are generally headless.

In debian based linux distributions, install the tools like so :

{{{
# aptitude install xvfb wkhtmltopdf
}}}
