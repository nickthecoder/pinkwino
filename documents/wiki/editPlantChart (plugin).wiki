When used in conjunction with [plantChart (plugin)], allows the chart to have ticks and crosses added to it.

The ticks and crosses are stored in a separate wiki page, which should end with ".json" to indicate that it is "JavaScript Object Notation".


===Note===

If you want to use the charts as a yearly checklist :
# Create a page, lets call it ''Checklist''
# Add the ''plantChart'' plugin to the "Checklist" page.
# Create another page, called ''Checklist 2016''
# On this page include the ''Checklist'' page, using the [include (plugin)]
# Add an ''editPlantChart'' plugin with a page name of ''Checklist 2016.json''

This will let you reuse the Checklist page every year.
