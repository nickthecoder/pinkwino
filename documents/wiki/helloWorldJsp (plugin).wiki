{{aside( page="plugins index")}}

An example plugin that renders "hello world", using a jsp page.

{{{
Welcome : {{helloWorldJsp}}
}}}

creates the following :

Welcome : {{helloWorldJsp}}

===  Notes ===

Note that ''Hello World'' is in its own paragraph (it isn't in the same paragraph as ''Welcome :'' (unlike the [helloWorld (plugin)]).

This is because helloWorldJsp has been defined as a ''block''.
Why did I do that?
If you are going to use a jsp page to render your plugin, its likely to be fairly complex, and so it will probably have a ``<div>`` or a ``<table>`` tag etc, so the paragraph ''Welcome :'' must be closed before the jsp plugin can begin.
(``<div>``s are not allowed inside ``<p>`` tags).
