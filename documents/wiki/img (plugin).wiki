{{aside( page="plugins index")}}

Display an image.

Note : For most purposes, the [image plugin|image (plugin)] is better than this one.

Unlike the ++image++ plugin, the ++img++ plugin is not a ''block'' element. I.e. it can be placed within a line of text.
This gives the ++img++ plugin one big advantage... if can be used as part of a link.

For example, if I had an image called "logo.png", then I could use that image as a link to the "home" page like so :
{{{
[{{img( page="logo.png")}}|home]
}}}

That looks quite complex, so lets break it down. A normal link with a label, is like this :
{{{
[my label|home]
}}}

and in the example above, I am just replacing the text "my label" with an image instead.
{{{
{{img( page="logo.png") }}
}}}
