{{aside( page="plugins index")}}

Floats the contents of the tag to the left of the page (using the css class ``wiki_left``).

== Example ==
{{left
This text is\\
pushed to the\\
left of the\\
page
}}
Meanwhile, this text can flow around it.

Note that the width of the box is determined by its contents, so I had to put line breaks (<nowiki>\\</nowiki>) to ensure it was quite narrow.
