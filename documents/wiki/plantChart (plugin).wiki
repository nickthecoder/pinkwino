Create a table like those found on seed packets describing when to sow seeds, when to plant out and when the crop will be ready to harvest.

The body of the "plantChart" plugin is a text representation of the chart. Each line of text is a row in the chart.

Each line is made up of 12 characters of each month of the year. Any amount of white space is ignored.

Use the characters to colour each table cell as follows :

* X : Blank
* I : Sow Indoors
* P : Plant Out
* H : Harvest
* F : Flowers
* C : Take Cuttings
* O : Other

If you wish, you can use lower case letters to split a month into two parts.

If you set the "labels" parameter to true, then the beginning of each line is a label for the row. To have spaces within the label, use the "pipe" "|" character to mark the end of the label.

==Example==

{{{
{{plantChart
X X X S X P X X H H  X X
}}
}}}

{{plantChart
X X X S X P X X H H  X X
}}

Here's a more complex example, with labels, and some months split into two (using lower case letters) :

{{{

{{plantChart(labels="true")
Lettuce     X  X  X  xs X  xp px X H  H  X  X
Sweet Pea|  X  X  X  S  X  F  F  F fx X  X  X
Multi-Line  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X S  X  X  X
            X  H  H  X  X  X  X  X X  X  X  X
}}
}}}

{{plantChart(labels="true")
Lettuce     X  X  X  xs X  xp px X H  H  X  X
Sweet Pea|  X  X  X  S  X  F  F  F fx X  X  X
Multi-Line  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X S  X  X  X
            X  H  H  X  X  X  X  X X  X  X  X
}}
