{{aside( page="plugins index")}}

Floats the contents of the tag to the right of the page (using the css class ``wiki_right``).

== Example ==
{{right
This text is\\
pushed to the\\
right of the\\
page
}}
Meanwhile, this text can flow around it.

Note that the width of the box is determined by its contents, so I had to put line breaks (<nowiki>\\</nowiki>) to ensure it was quite narrow.
