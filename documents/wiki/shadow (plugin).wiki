{{aside( page="plugins index")}}


Similar to the [image (plugin)], but it processes the image first - shrinking the image if its too big, and then adds a drop shadow.

Here's an example :

{{shadow( page="graduation.png" )\\My [graduation|graduation.png] day}}


{{{
{{shadow( page="graduation.png" )\\My [graduation|graduation.png] day}}
}}}

See also [thumbnail (plugin)], [teaser (plugin)].
