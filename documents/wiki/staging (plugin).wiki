{{aside( page="plugins index")}}

This is a conditional plugin, that is to say, it only renders the body of the plugin if a given criteria is met.

In this case the body will be rendered if the wiki attribute ``pinkwino_static`` == false.

It was designed to be used in conjunction with the [makeStatic (plugin)], to allow some content to only be shown on the ++staging++ page, not in the ++live++ site.

If your wiki does not use the [makeStatic (plugin)], this plugin is probably not useful.
