{{aside( page="plugins index")}}


Includes the contents of a template into the current page, substituting parameters along the way.

The template is an ordinary wiki page, with variable names embedded in it. The format of a variable name is :
{{{
${foo}
}}}


== Plugin Details ==

{{plugin( plugin="template")}}

In addition to the "page" parameter, you can include as many parameters as you wish.
The names of these additional parameters depend upon which template page you are using.

== Example ==

If a template called "myTemplate" contained the following :
{{{
Hello ${name}, why not have a look at [${link}]?
}}}

then you could include it into a page as follows :
{{{
{{template( page="myTemplate" name="Nick" link="wiki/hints" ) }}
}}}

The result would be :

Hello Nick, why not have a look at [wiki/hints]
