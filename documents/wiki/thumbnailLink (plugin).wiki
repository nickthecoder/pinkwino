Works in conjunction with the [captureWebPage (plugin)], to create a thumbnail of a web page, and the image a link to that page.

The thumbnail, and the full size image of the web page are stored in a wiki page, just as if it were uploaded to the wiki as usual.

If you want to update the image, go to its page, and you should find a button which will re-capture the web page image.

Here's an example, using [http://ubuntu.com] as an example :

{{{
{{center
{{thumbnailLink( url="http://ubuntu.com" page="ubuntu.com.png" )}}
}}
}}}

{{center
{{thumbnailLink( url="http://ubuntu.com" page="ubuntu.com.png" )}}
}}

You can see the page that was generated by the plugin : [ubuntu.com.png]
