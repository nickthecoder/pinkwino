Use the latest Lucene???

Ensure Lucene database is updated after a page is updated.


Add a new WikiPageListener to inform Ichneutae that a page has changed.
    Also one to inform the OTHER pinkwino instance (i.e. giddyserv vs nickthecoder.co.uk)

Rename goes weird. Only with non-default namepsace. Permissions?
   Add <!-- renamed from ... --> to the new page??

Google maps plugin
    start, startLatitude and startLongitude currently don't work.
    Rename the google map link plugin to googleMapStartLink
    Make a googleMapTargetLink too ?

    Include a region parameter/attribute which defaults to "uk".

Switch Over
===========

Rename software/Home to software/Software etc.

Fix Recipe's Index page (as well as others?) It currently lists the default namespace.

Rearrange the filesystem of the wiki documents. Only have one "content" directory for ntc and giggyserv
    containing garden, softare, default, etc.

chown tomcat:shared on all of the wiki documents.

Reindex (lucene)
