Consider renaming the "common" groovy scripts.
    Place them in the core's jar file, so that embedded can use them???



Garden styles see : http://localhost:8080/pinkwino-application/view/garden/Antirrhinum

Create documentation in the wiki namespace describing how to create your own standalone instance,
and also how to embed pinkwino.

Remove the InputStream return result from media stuff, because it can never be done
on the fly using the new system.


Google maps plugin
    start startLatitude and startLongitude currently don't work.
    Rename the google map link plugin to googleMapStartLink
    Make a googleMapTargetLink too ?

    Include a region parameter/attribute which defaults to "uk".

Rename goes weird. Only with non-default namepsace. Permissions?
   Add <!-- renamed from ... -->.


Switch Over
===========

Rearrange the filesystem of the wiki documents. Only have one "content" directory for ntc and giggyserv
    containing garden, softare, default, etc.

chown tomcat:shared on all of the wiki documents.
