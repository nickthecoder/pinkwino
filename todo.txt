Create a summary
    Put it in webwidgets
        Use the same summary in Ichneutae - removing crap code.

Lucene content should be text only, not wiki markup. Use the syntax tree and each node's text.

Check Lucene results are updated after a page is updated.


Add a new WikiPageListener to inform Ichneutae that a page has changed.
    Also one to inform the OTHER pinkwino instance (i.e. giddyserv vs ickthecoder.co.uk)
        Create a LuceneDebug plugin, which show metadata for any given page.
        Also has a button to update the metadata.
            This post can be used by this ofther WikiPageListener.

Google maps plugin
    start, startLatitude and startLongitude currently don't work.
    Rename the google map link plugin to googleMapStartLink
    Make a googleMapTargetLink too ?

    Include a region parameter/attribute which defaults to "uk".

Switch Over
===========

Rename software/Home to software/Software etc.

Fix Recipe's Index page (as well as others?) It currently lists the default namespace.

Rearrange the filesystem of the wiki documents. Only have one "content" directory for ntc and giggyserv
    containing garden, softare, default, etc.

chown tomcat:shared on all of the wiki documents.

Reindex (lucene)
